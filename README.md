Hi there! My name is `Chandler Ellsworth` and I am currently pursuing my `Master of Statistics at NC State`, with an expected graduation of summer 2024. I am looking forward to the next chapter of my career. Below you can find various projects that I completed in two of my programming classes, `ST 590: Analysis of Big Data` and `ST 558: Data Science for Statisticians`. `ST 590` was a course centered around `Python`, while `ST 558` was centered around `R`. The projects provided through the links below are not inclusive of all assignments in these classes or projects completed in other classes, but provide a relevant sample to common tasks performed in the workforce!

## ST 590 Python Projects - Spring 2023

[Project 1: Writing Functions, Manipulating & Processing Data](Project1FINAL.html)  
The purpose of this project is to provide a guide as to how to read in and process data in `python`, as well as create, test, and judge `linear models`. The overall objectives are as follows:  

* `Write functions` that will manipulate and process data sets that come in a certain form  
* Create and fit basic `linear regression models`  
* Create a `cross-validation` function to judge the models  

[Project 2: Basic SQL](ST590-Project2Part2.html)  
[Project 2: Spark SQL & Pandas-on-Spark](ST590-Project2Part3.html)

The purpose of the first part of the project (top link) is to connect to a `Database` and summarize employee performance using basic `SQL` and plotting commands.  
The purpose of the second part of the project (bottom link) is to analyze NFL data across different seasons using `Spark SQL` and `Pandas-on-Spark`.

[Project 3: PySpark](ST590-Project3.html)  
The purpose of this project is to fit `supervised learning` models using `PySpark` to the bike sharing dataset found on the UCI machine learning repository.

[Project 4: PySpark's MLib & Streaming Data](ST590-Project4.html)  
The purpose of this project is to fit a machine learning model using `PySparkâ€™s MLlib` module, write code to read in a `stream` of data using a `.py` file, and then use the model to make predictions on the stream and write those out to the console.
