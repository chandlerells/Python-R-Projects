Hi there! My name is `Chandler Ellsworth` and I am currently pursuing my `Master of Statistics at NC State`, with an expected graduation of summer 2024. I am looking forward to the next chapter of my career. Below you can find various projects that I completed in two of my programming classes, `ST 590: Analysis of Big Data` and `ST 558: Data Science for Statisticians`. `ST 590` was a course centered around `Python`, while `ST 558` was centered around `R`. The projects provided through the links below are not inclusive of all assignments in these classes or projects completed in other classes, but provide a relevant sample to common tasks performed in the workforce! While a general description of the purpose for each project is provided below the link, more information can be found within each project link.

## ST 590 Python Projects - Spring 2023

[Project 1: Writing Functions, Manipulating & Processing Data](Project1FINAL.html)  
The purpose of this project is to provide a guide as to how to read in and process data in `Python`, as well as create, test, and judge `linear models`. The overall objectives are as follows:  
* `Write functions` that will manipulate and process data sets that come in a certain form  
* Create and fit basic `linear regression models`  
* Create a `cross-validation` function to judge the models  

[Project 2: Basic SQL](ST590-Project2Part2.html)  
[Project 2: Spark SQL & Pandas-on-Spark](ST590-Project2Part3.html)

The purpose of the first part of the project (top link) is to connect to a `Database` and summarize employee performance using basic `SQL` and plotting commands.  
The purpose of the second part of the project (bottom link) is to analyze NFL data across different seasons using `Spark SQL` and `Pandas-on-Spark`.

[Project 3: PySpark](ST590-Project3.html)  
The purpose of this project is to fit `supervised learning` models using `PySpark` to the bike sharing dataset found on the UCI machine learning repository.

[Project 4: PySpark's MLib & Streaming Data](ST590-Project4.html)  
The purpose of this project is to fit a machine learning model using `PySparkâ€™s MLlib` module, write code to read in a `stream` of data using a `.py` file, and then use the model to make predictions on the stream and write those out to the console.

## ST 558 R Projects - Fall 2023

[Project 1:  Writing Functions, Manipulating, Processing, & Plotting Data](Warren_Ellsworth_ST-558-Project-1.html)   
The purpose of this project is to provide a guide as to how to read in and process data in `R` using csv files from the Census Bureau. The overall objectives are as follows:  
* `Write functions` that will manipulate and process data sets that come in a certain form  
* Create a generic function to `automatically plot` the returned data  

[Project 2: CFBD-API-Vignette](ST558-Project-2.html)  
The purpose of this project is to document a `vignette` about contacting the `CollegeFootballData.com (CFBD) API` using created `functions` to `query`, `parse`, and `return` well-structured data. The `functions` are used to `obtain data` from the `CFBD API` as well as some basic `exploratory data analysis`.  

[Project 3: R Markdown Automation](https://ericwarren9.github.io/ST-558-Project-3/)  
The purpose of this project is to create `predictive models` and `automate R markdown reports` utilizing the `Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset`.  

[Project 4: R Shiny Application](https://chandlerells.shinyapps.io/st-558-final-project/)  
The purpose of this project is to create and deploy an `R Shiny application` to explore and model `NBA data` from the 2022-23 season, sepcifically using `salary` as the response.
