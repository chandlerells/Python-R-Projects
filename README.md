## Python Projects - Spring 2023

[Writing Functions, Manipulating & Processing Data](Project1FINAL.html)
The purpose of this project is to provide a guide as to how to read in and process data in `python`, as well as create, test, and judge `linear models`. The overall objectives are as follows:  

* `Write functions` that will manipulate and process data sets that come in a certain form  
* Create and fit basic `linear regression models`  
* Create a `cross-validation` function to judge the models  

[Basic SQL](ST 590 - Project 2 Part 2.html)
[Spark SQL & Pandas-on-Spark](`ST 590 - Project 2 Part 3.html`)
The purpose of the first part of the project (top link) is to connect to a `Database` and summarize employee performance using basic `SQL` and plotting commands.
The purpose of the second part of the project (bottom link) is to analyze NFL data across different seasons using `Spark SQL` and `Pandas-on-Spark`.

[PySpark](`ST 590 - Project 3.html`)
The purpose of this project is to fit `supervised learning` models using `PySpark` to the bike sharing dataset found on the UCI machine learning repository.

[PySpark's MLib & Streaming Data](`ST 590 - Project 4.html`)
The purpose of this project is to fit a machine learning model using `PySparkâ€™s MLlib` module, write code to read in a `stream` of data using a `.py` file, and then use the model to make predictions on the stream and write those out to the console.
